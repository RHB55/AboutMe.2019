## Project overview

For this project, you will create a business file Web site.
A traditional version of the design will be provided as a PDF file, and you should repeat this design in HTML and CSS. 
You will develop a responsive web site that will display images, specifications
and links to each of the business file projects that you will complete through the Nanodegree program track. 
Please note that while you should aim to recreate a traditional version, you can also use your custom images to customize this project.

Once you replicate the traditional version of the design successfully, this prompts you to continue tweaking and customizing customizations to personalize your preferences! This is the real-life business file location, so be content with it.
## Why this project?

The first thing that potential employers look for is not the school you went to or the grade you earned; You need a professional business file to showcase your skills.

In this project, you will create a wonderful business file where you can show photos, specifications and links to all your projects. You can do this by typing the code that corresponds to the Udacity guide.

## What will I learn?
You'll learn how to use HTML to define the content of a web page and start thinking about each web page as a number of squares on the screen. Then you will learn how to put these squares and make them wonderful using CSS.

You have to do this in accordance with the Guide, which is an important restriction once you enter any current development situation.
